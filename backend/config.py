# It's recommended to store secrets in a .env file for security,
# but you can also set them directly here for simplicity during development.
# To use a .env file: create a file named '.env' in the 'backend' folder
# and add these lines to it:
# WIX_EMAIL="your-email@example.com"
# WIX_PASSWORD="your-super-secret-password"
